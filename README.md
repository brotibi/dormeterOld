Dormeter Project
## What is Dormeter?
Dormeter originally started off as a project known as TheCollegeDorm, it was website that would be a place for college students to rate there dorms, and search for reviews of other dorms. Dormeter takes that idea, but instead of the site being written in PHP it now uses Node.js and Express.js. The development of Dormeter was a project I set out to teach myself Node and Express(I also used Bootstrap3 for the first time when working on this project). In addition to that it helped me learn more about databases, specifically the NoSQL database MongoDB.

## Why has this project been discontinued
I've decided to move away from this stack. My stack for this project was MongoDB(the Database Management System), EJS(Allows JS injection into HTML files, also this is for the frontend), Node.js and Express(This is for the backend, it's what runs on the server). I'm not calling the project stack bad or the idea bad, and I haven't lost interest in the project, I just want to move on to work on something new. In the future I'll probably rewrite this project using a REST API written in GO, a PostgreSQL DBMS, and something like React or Flutter for the frontend.

## Check out the project live
Go to dormeter.com to see what this project looks like.

## Wanna run this project locally
- First step is to clone this repository.

- To run the project you'll need to go into the projects /config/db.js and modify the database configuration
to your liking(It just has to be a MongoDB DBMS) the file is just for configuring a database connection.

- Then in your terminal cd into this project folder an type in ```node app``` to start the program.
